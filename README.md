# miprocesoapp
This project was developed for the consumption of the Attorney General's Office API in Colombia, where we will obtain data about all kinds of legal processes. We can access a legal process, view its legal actions, view the documents attached to them, and/or upload our own document. Additionally, we have an interface where we can subscribe to the process and add it to favorites. Currently, this project is only the front-end and design of the application, but work is being done on its back-end using solutions such as Firebase and back-ends directly developed by TypeScript programmers.
